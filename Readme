The main focus of our research is on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multi-label classification approaches.
Our goal is to classify research papers into several labels such as Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics etc
Incorporated 5 different approaches

1. Word Embeddings and Machine learning models
2. BERT
3. Neural Networks
4. LLM - Mistral 7B
5. Ensemble method - Rakel Algorithm

BERT achieved the highest accuracy with 91% among all methods and algorithms tested, likely due to its
ability to capture complex language patterns and relationships.
